# Getting Started

Set up your environment and start creating content.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
* Setup prerequisites needed for development

## Before you start

List the prerequisites that are required or recommended.

Make sure that:
- Linux is installed (WSL, Ubuntu, or Linux)
- Node.js is installed

## Part 1: Setting up the environment

Describe what the user will learn and accomplish in the first part,
then write a step-by-step procedure but on a real-world example.

### Downloading a Package Manager
In TimBuilding, we use `pnpm` and `yarn` as package managers.
I generally recommend downloading both as we use them interchangeably.

Execute the following command to install both package managers:
   
   ```javascript
   # Install pnpm
    npm install -g pnpm
   
   # And install yarn
    npm install -g yarn
   
   ```


## Part 2: Sign up with GitHub

We use GitHub to host our repositories and manage our code.

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Sign up for a new account
3. Verify your email address
4. Enable two-factor authentication
5. Join the [TimBuilding organization](https://github.com/timbuilding) (important)
6. Download and install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)


## Part 3: Create a Graphite account

Graphite helps with the Stacking workflow and is essential for development.

1. Create an account on [Graphite](https://graphite.dev) using your **GitHub account**.
2. Under the User settings -> GitHub Authentication. Add _TimBuilding Organization_ to your account.
